Summary:
This project focuses on developing a cross-platform mobile application designed to help users manage their personal finances.

Key Tasks:
1. Create wireframes and UI/UX designs for the app interface.
2. Develop core features, including expense tracking, goal setting, and data synchronization.
3. Integrate secure payment APIs for linking bank accounts and processing transactions.
4. Test the application for compatibility across iOS and Android platforms.
5. Plan and execute a beta testing phase with real users to gather feedback.
